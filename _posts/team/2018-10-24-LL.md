Léa Lasson, engineer, is currently in charge of the activities related to the spatial hydrology in the project context VOLODIA. This project aims to define, validate and promote by their scientific use new methods of spatial data processing for hydrology (altimetry data and imagery). The objective is
to work on the altimetry measurements conversion into water levels and water flow on a global scale.
She is graduated from the science university of Montpellier in fundamental physics, and has a master in Spatial technique and instrumentation from the university Paul Sabatier of Toulouse, obtained in September 2017. During this last year of study, she performed her last year internship at the CNES on data processing and instrumentation for spatial hydrology. 
Before joining Ocean Next in April 2018, she acquired during her years of study, different scientific and technical skills in physics and more particularly in the spatial field. Then, she began to work at the end of her studies at LEGOS (Laboratoire d'Etudes en Géophysique et Océanographie Spatiales)
on the preparation of different tools useful to the project VOLODIA.
Her young engineering experience in the field cover the altimetry data analysis and processing applied to the hydrology. She has developed tools which aim is to validate the data for the rest of the project. As well, she's involved in the elaboration, update and validation of hydrological targets
database which are used by space agencies to improve the behavior of radar altimeters on them continental waters.
