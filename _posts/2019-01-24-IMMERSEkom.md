[![New frontiers in operational oceanography]({{ site.urlimg }}godae_book2.png "New frontiers in operational oceanography")]({{ site.urlimg }}godae_book2.png)
In the coming years, graduate students and young scientists will be challenged by many new observations (SWOT, Sentinel, AUVs, floats, etc.), complex high-resolution numerical models and data assimilation (high resolution, predictability, uncertainty, changing computing platforms, etc.), and the need to work on many scales (open ocean-shelf interactions, coupled ocean-ice-atmosphere,biogeochemistry, etc.). The latter school brought together senior experts and young researchers (pre- and post-doctorate) from across the world and exposed them to the latest research in oceanography, specifically how it will impact operational oceanography. 

This book is a compilation of the lectures presented at the school and presents a summary of the current state-of-the-art in operational oceanography research.

[You can access the chapters of the book in pdf from the GODAE Oceanview website (click here).](https://www.godae-oceanview.org/outreach/education-training/gov-summer-school-2017/publication/)
