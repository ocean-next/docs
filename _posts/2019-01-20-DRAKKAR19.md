teaser: "Laurent Brodeau presented the most recent updates  on  the  design,  status,  and  the  first  diagnostics  of  our  ongoing  multiyear long sensitivity twin experiment performed with a basin scale model at kilometric resolution. A simulation is now being performed  with  tidal  motion  and  another  without.  One  of  the  main scientific  purpose  of  this  twin experiment, which has mainly  been designed in preparation for the upcoming SWOT satellite altimetry mission, is to assess the impact of the explicit representation of tides."

The model used, eNATL60, is a basin scale configuration of NEMO (Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean) that spans the  North  Atlantic  from  about  6°N  up  to  the  polar  circle,  and  fully  includes  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  and  the  Black  Sea.  The  horizontal  grid  resolution  is about  1/60°  while  the  vertical dimension is discretized along 300 levels, for a complete computational domain of 10 billion points.

The [DRAKKAR workshop](http://pp.ige-grenoble.fr/pageperso/barnierb/WEBDRAKKAR2019/) is organized by our partner MEOM/IGE in Grenoble every year in january since many years. The aim of the workshop is to review the scientific and technical progresses achieved with the DRAKKAR hierarchy of model configurations based on the NEMO platform, identify strengths and weaknesses of these models, and discuss key model improvements and new developments that are needed for the future.
