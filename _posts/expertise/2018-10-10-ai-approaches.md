### CMESM-3DA
Ocean Next collaborates  with [Pierre Tand√©o](https://tandeo.wordpress.com/results/) and [Ronan Fablet](https://perso.telecom-bretagne.eu/ronanfablet/), experts in applied maths and  machine learning methods at [IMTA](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr/recherche-et-innovation/laboratoires/lab-sticc), Brest, France on a [CMEMS projet named 3DA](https://www.mercator-ocean.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3DA_Kickoff_SE2_CMEMS.pdf). This project aims to investigate the use of the [AnDA method](https://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0441.1) (Analog Data Assimilation, developed at IMTA) in combination with a catalog database made from a [large-ensemble ocean eddy-resolving simulation](/expertise/ensembles/). The main goal is to evaluate and demonstrate the relevance of such data-driven strategies to improve satellite-derived interpolated products.
