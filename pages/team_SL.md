![Stephanie]({{ site.urlimg }}team-SL.jpg "Stephanie Leroux")

Stephanie Leroux, PhD, is currently in charge of the activities related to ensemble approaches in ocean numerical modeling and data analysis.
She has a background in Geophysics, Earth and Environmental sciences from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and from Université de Grenoble, France. She graduated in 2009 with a PhD in atmospheric dynamics from Université de Grenoble, France. 
Before joining Ocean Next in july 2017, she has been working as a postdoc and a research assistant in various research institutes, including three years in the USA, at NOAA, Colorado, and SUNY, New York, and four years in France at CNRM/Météo-France, Toulouse, and MEOM/IGE, Grenoble.
Her research experience covers a wide range of topics in ocean, atmosphere and climate sciences, including eddy-permitting ocean GCMs and ensemble simulations, ocean low-frequency intrinsic variability, atmospheric GCMs and atmospheric tropical variability, monsoon, teleconnexions.
She gained a strong technical expertise in designing and running ocean and atmosphere numerical experiments with Ocean and Atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) of different types, e.g. full-physics, idealized, data-driven; in developing appropriate numerical tools and metrics;  and in performing statistical analyses on numerical model outputs and observational datasets.
