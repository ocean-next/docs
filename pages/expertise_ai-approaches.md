Over the last decades, altimeter and other satellite observations have provided crucial information to increase our knowledge of the global oceanic state, its variability, and long-term changes. With the increasing resolution of the next generations of satellites,  and the still crucial  need for near-real-time products for operational purposes,  it becomes more and more important  to be able to process and operate efficiently with larger and larger amounts of data. Methods  and tools developed  in the field of Data Science might bring interesting and promising alternative approaches for some applications in spatial oceanography.
At Ocean Next, we  consider that combine approaches
