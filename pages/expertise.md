Some examples:

* [Construction of an hydrological database at the global scale]().

* [Design  of numerical ocean simulations at  ultrahigh resolution to investigate the role of submesoscale oceanic turbulence in the Earthâ€™s climate.]()
 
* [Learning from large-ensemble ocean simulations to better interpret satellite and in-situ ocean data.]()
 
* [Explore and apply some approaches and tools from Artificial Intelligence in the context data assimilation in oceanography.]()
