Aurélie Albert, PhD, is currently in charge of the distribution of high-resolution simulations of the ocean, fine scales analysis and big data management and solutions. She has a background in Environmental Sciences from Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Techniques Avancées. She graduated in 2011 with a PhD in physical and biogeochemical oceanography from Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris VI.

Throughout her collaborations with Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat in Paris, with l'Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement in Grenoble and with Mercator Océan in Toulouse, she has gained a strong experience in ocean modeling with NEMO and biogeochemical modeling with PISCES, at multiple spatial resolution and time frames from climatological global simulations to very high resolution regional configurations. During her time as a research engineer, she has become an expert in managing very big amount of data and performing complex scientific diagnostics with various programation language on various computation platforms (HPC, clusters, cloud).
