Our participation in this project concerns:

- the integration of the most recent satellite observations (such as  Jason-3, Sentinel-3) and the  preparation for the soon coming SWOT data,
- the integration of older datasets such as Toex/Poseidon, ERS, Envisat, GFO, in order to increase the time coverage in for climate perspective,
- the improvement of the algorithms to access the hydrological variables from satellite data,
- the definition of  a “smart” network of reference locations  (virtual stations) to cover of the globe in an homogenous and consistent way,
- a more focused investigation of some specific hydrological regions of crucial importance, in which new methods will be applied, tested and documented.
- 
And more generally, we participate in the design of this database, taking into consideration not only its  research/science dimension (to improve our understanding and forecast-skills of inland waters, which play a crucial role in the Earth’s climate) but also taking into account its environmental, economical, geopolitical dimensions.
