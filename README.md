## This is where we develop our webpage. 

# To see our official website, go there: [www.ocean-next.fr](www.ocean-next.fr)

### Developers :
* Develop in your own branch (and build and see your modified site locally with ```jekyll serve -w --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml ```)
* Then merge with the master branch
* You can see the result there https://ocean-next.github.io/index.html
* When happy with your modifications, build the final site locally with ```jekyll serve -w --config _configfinal.yml``` then   transfer the content of the ```_site/``` repository to our official webpage ([www.ocean-next.fr](www.ocean-next.fr))
