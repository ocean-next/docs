				<title>Design  of numerical ocean simulations at  kilometric resolution to investigate the role of submesoscale oceanic turbulence in the Earth’s climate.</title>
				<link>http://localhost:4000/expertise/natl60/</link>
				<pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;ReSuMPTiOn is a project  that aims to determine the contribution of kilometric-scale oceanic flow features, known as submesoscale turbulence, in several aspects of the global oceanic circulation known for their importance in regulating the Earth’s climate. To achieve this, realistic numerical simulations of the full 3D oceanic flow in the North Atlantic basin, at ultra-high horizontal and vertical resolution, have been designed and and are currently performed by Ocean Next in close collaboration with the MEOM team at IGE.
As such, the so-called eNATL60 configuration (see technical specifications below), based on the NEMO ocean model, has been developed. eNATL60 simulations are presently being performed on the MareNostrum supercomputer of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, thanks to a 40 million CPU-hour PRACE allocation granted to Ocean Next in april 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of ultrahigh resolution ocean flow simulations (~1 km horizontal grid resolution on 300 vertical levels, with the inclusion of tidal motions), has only been made achievable recently thanks to the advance in HPC capabilities of modern supercomputers. Besides providing the project team and the ocean/climate community with a pioneering dataset for studying the interactions between fine-scale features and the larger-scale components of oceanic flow, the proposed set of simulations will also be used for preparing upcoming satellite missions, including the SWOT altimetry mission. SWOT will provide observations of the surface ocean dynamics at an unprecedented fine-scale resolution. The present project will allow to develop a system ready to prepare, assimilate, interpret, and further expand (e.g. below the surface) the information that will be obtained from SWOT. This new generation of high spatial resolution altimetric satellite observations from the SWOT mission, combined to the set of proposed ground-breaking ocean simulations, is expected to lead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of the roles played by fine-scale ocean turbulence (and tidal motions) in influencing the large-scale ocean circulation, and thereby, the climate system. The simulations of this project will also be used as a testbed for designing the next generation of models for the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A global database for hydrological data</title>
				<link>http://localhost:4000/expertise/hydro/</link>
				<pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Our participation in this project concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the integration of the most recent satellite observations (such as  Jason-3, Sentinel-3) and the  preparation for the soon coming SWOT data,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the integration of older datasets such as Toex/Poseidon, ERS, Envisat, GFO, in order to increase the time coverage in for climate perspective,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the improvement of the algorithms to access the hydrological variables from satellite data,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the definition of  a “smart” network of reference locations  (virtual stations) to cover of the globe in an homogenous and consistent way,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a more focused investigation of some specific hydrological regions of crucial importance, in which new methods will be applied, tested and documented.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And more generally, we participate in the design of this database, taking into consideration not only its  research/science dimension (to improve our understanding and forecast-skills of inland waters, which play a crucial role in the Earth’s climate) but also taking into account its environmental, economical, geopolitical dimensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Learning from large-ensemble ocean simulations to better interpret satellite and in-situ ocean data.</title>
				<link>http://localhost:4000/expertise/ensembles/</link>
				<pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last decades, altimeter and other satellite and in-situ ocean observations have provided crucial information to increase our knowledge of the global oceanic state, its variability, and long-term changes. Comparing observations to ocean numerical simulations is a routinely-used approach to either validate models,  calibrate new observation systems, or investigate physical processes and mechanisms.  But such comparison requires some knowledge of the different types of uncertainties attached to the compared datasets.
Given the chaotic, non-linear nature of the ocean system, ocean models in the turbulent regime are highly sensitive to initial conditions and spontaneously generate a chaotic intrinsic variability that has recently been shown to be significant even on interannual and longer time-scale,  and on entire basins  (e.g. Penduff et al, 2011, Serazin et al, 2015, Leroux et al 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performing ensemble simulations is a way to take into account this intrinsic uncertainty, inherent to the ocean circulation, by sampling a range of possible trajectories of equal likelihood.
In other words, it means that the most accurate collection of satellite/in-situ observations can only fit a model simulation up to a certain point, as  the observations describe the one time-evolution that the ocean state has followed in reality, randomly picked among an ensemble of possible evolutions seen as equally-likely by an ocean model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Ocean Next, in a partnership with the MEOM group at IGE, Grenoble in several projects (e.g.  PIRATE-OSTST also related to CNES, CMEMS-GLO-HR also related to Mercator Ocean) we develop such probabilistic approaches, based on large-ensemble eddy-permitting ocean simulations. Our goal is to better quantify and characterize the model uncertainty related to the intrinsic variability of the ocean, and to provide useful information to better interpret satellite and in-situ ocean data. It includes  a quantification of the chaotic variability and a better characterization of the locations, depth, temporal and spatial scales that are the most affected by a chaotic behaviour in models, and which are thus  affected by  the largest uncertainty in any comparison with satellite or in-situ observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/occi.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/occi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fig1&quot; title=&quot;Fig1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fig1: This scheme presents the setup of a large-ensemble simulation of 50 members performed and analyzed in collaboration with  IGE, GrenobleIt has been designed to take into account the model uncertainty coming  from the initial conditions and the fact that the simulated ocean has a turbulent/chaotic behavior. Instead of a deterministic description of the ocean state with time, the ensemble simulation provides a probabilistic description of the ocean state (i.e. a statistical distribution) at each time step. It allows for the detection of local non-gaussian behaviors  for example (see Fig.2). For more information on this ensemble simulation, see &lt;a href=&quot;Geosci.Model Dev., 10, 1091-1106, doi:10.5194/gmd-10-1091-2017 Development of a probabilistic ocean modelling system based on NEMO 3.5: application at eddying resolution&quot;&gt;Bessière et al, 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/GMocci.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GMocci.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fig2&quot; title=&quot;Fig2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fig2: The probabilistic description of the ocean state  allows for the detection of areas where the ocean has a strongly non-gaussian behavior, such as in the Gulf of Mexico (Figure), where a bi-modal distribution is detected in the loop-current, and an asymmetrical distribution is detected further in the Gulf, along the trajectory of the eddies released by the loop-current with an irregular frequency and then advected westward in the Gulf. The figure above shows the sea-level-height  (SSH) distribution of the 50 members of the large-ensemble simulation, and compare with the AVISO satellite observation time-series. The model spread and its variations with time give an indication of the range of values (and probability) in which the satellite observations are expected to fall at each location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
